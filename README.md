##Side Scroller | 2.5D | Simple | Low Poly

What we have:

Player mechanics - Walk | Jump (Kill enemies by jumping on them) | Health | Death


Level
Start/Finish (AKA spawn at start and level stop at the end)


Objectives - 
	Win - Eliminate enemies and finish the level
Fail  - Fall off the level / death by an enemy

Enemies - 
\\before the first encounter we can introduce the shoot/hit ability on something like a breakable wall or something like that\\ (not necessary for now)

Enemies kill by touching the player


Enemy (x) placement and level design:
Start/Spawn
	Short traversal (jump one or two platforms - aka introducing mechanic (jump)) 
1x Enemy after that (1 jump to kill)
	Short traversal 
2x Enemies
Traversal + puzzle (succeed jumping to a specific platform in order to proceed)
Some environment/level changes that suggest incoming boss battle (something visually different)
1x Boss at the end (3 jumps to kill)
	-Boss moves faster than the regular enemies
